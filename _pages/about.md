Hi there! 

I obtained both my BSc. in Physics and my MSc. in Data Analytics at [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk).

My research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Data Science. More specifically, I am interested in finding insights from social media analysis and was able to do this when working on my MSc Dissertation project, where I performed sentiment analysis on tweets about the 2020 US Presidential Election and aimed to predict the outcome. 

I still maintain an interest in physics and I enjoy reading about new findings in fields such as particle physics, gravitational waves and renewable technologies. In addition to this I am interested in novel approaches to outreach, specifically in science and programming.

When I'm not working or researching, I enjoy improving my fluency in foreign languages. I am currently studying German at a higher intermediate level.
