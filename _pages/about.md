Hi there! 

I obtained both my BSc. in Physics and my MSc. in Data Analytics at [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk).

My own research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Data Science. More specifically, I am interested in finding insights from social media analysis and more recently was able to put this to use when working on my MSc Dissertation project, where I performed sentiment analysis on tweets about the 2020 US Presidential Election. This dissertation can be read [here](#).

I was instrumental in setting up Cookies and Code, an initiative to teach novices how to program in Python. I coauthored the initial teaching material and ran the sessions.
