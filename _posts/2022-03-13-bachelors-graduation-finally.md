On Friday I was able to have a much awaited and long delayed graduation ceremony to celebrate the achievement of my BSc in Physics. It had been delayed as a result of Covid19, so much so that at times I wondered whether I was ever going to have a graduation ceremony.

Of course, life didn't stop still and everyone has also been busy in the last 18 months or so. Some, like me, have been studying their masters and are about to start their PhD (if they haven't already). Others have started working. The graduation ceremony also served as a sort of reunion and being able to chat to people I've not seen for a while and hear what they've been up to was excellent. 

My next ceremony to celebrate my masters will be in October and it will be good to finally meet people who I've largely only met online due to the restrictions on learning during my MSc.
