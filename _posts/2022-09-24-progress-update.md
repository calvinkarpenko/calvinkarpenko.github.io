It's been a while since I last posted on here, largely because I've been pretty busy.

I successfully completed my German module and its exams, meaning my level of German is now at a higher intermediate level. I am intending to begin studies to bring that to an advanced level this academic year. For those who use CEFR, I am at B1+ and I am beginning studies to bring that to B2 level. 

I have also been working on my User Management System and I have a prototype of a login system completed. I'll post a further update on that in the coming days where I will cover what features have been added and what is yet to be done. Needless to say, there has been some major progress made on this recently.

Less progress has been made however on my project to create a dataset of tweets on the next UK General Election. The risk of an early general election happening has in my assessment subsided so I intend to take some more time planning this and speaking to academic contacts. In addition to this Twitter appear to be making changes to their APIs so while I have written code already to access it, this may need some changes to be made.

I'm also considering adding another section to this website - "Policy" where I talk about policy ideas or thoughts on existing policy. I'm not completely convinced on that yet though.
